Bangkit Group Project (Assignment 5)

We need to learn what we have learned so far through the Machine Learning Crash Course provided by Bangkit,
by choosing a Kaggle dataset and create our own model for it.

Our team consists of 3 people from Jakarta Cohort - Class 5:
Fransisca Kenny Sibarani - fransiscakls18@gmail.com - fransiscakenny
Fiona Vidra - fionavidra95@gmail.com - fionavidra
Indra Wijaya - indra.wijaya2303@gmail.com - indrawijaya23

________

Our project is about create Machine Learning model to classify finding on lung based on someone's Chest X-ray Image 
into 9 types of finding (atelectasis, consolidation, effusion, infiltration, mass, nodule, pleural thickening, pneumothorax, no finding).
